## Publications

This section would normally display your publications using the `jekyll-scholar` plugin. Since GitHub Pages doesn't support this plugin, you can manually add your publications in Markdown format below, or use one of these alternatives:

1. **Manual Listing**: Add your publications directly in this file using Markdown
2. **External Link**: Link to an external publications page (e.g., Google Scholar, ORCID)
3. **PDF List**: Upload a PDF of your CV or publications list and link to it here

### Example Publication

**Title of your publication**  
*Author 1*, Author 2, Author 3  
*Journal/Conference Name*, Year  
[DOI/PDF](#) | [BibTeX](#)
